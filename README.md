# Svelte and Leaflet Demo

This is a demo application using Svelte and Leaflet to visualize the US Census "Metro Area-to-Metro Area Migration Flows‚Äù dataset.

If you like this, check out my [Svelte MapLibre library](https://github.com/dimfeld/svelte-maplibre) too.

This repository contains two versions of the application. The `full` directory is the
finished product, while the `skeleton` directory just contains a basic shell that renders nothing, which I
filled in during the presentation to build into the complete app.

Developed for a [presentation to JavascriptLA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-klB-EocorE&t=770s) (video) on November 11, 2020.
